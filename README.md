# Gogaurdian-strat-for-idiots-who-didn-t-find-it-themselves-
This is for idiots who didn't figure it out themselves, LIKE ME

# What and why?
This is for idiots like me who were like "How the hell do I turn off gogaurdian without shutting down other extensions????!!!"

# WHADDA HELL DO I DO????!
So first, you want to make sure you have dev tools on. If you are turning it on, you will see it here in the top right corner.

Then click it, it should look like this:

<br>On the side, you'll also see some tools.<br>

Now with that shit done, you are gonna wanna go down to the gogaurdian extension, and you should see this option that wasn't here before.

<br>Click on the Service Worker and paste in this code:<br>

<br>chrome.management.setEnabled (‘jjfeehgdeghiknkilcildnjofkcndjcm’ , false)<br>

<br>chrome.management.setEnabled (‘haldlgldplgnggkjaafhelgiaglafanh’ , false)<br>

<br>Also, before you enter the code, you must delete and re-enter the quotes.<br>
